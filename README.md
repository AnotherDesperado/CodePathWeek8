# CodePathWeek8
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Enumeration Attack

Vulnerability #2: Stored XSS


## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

Vulnerability #2: CSRF


## Notes

Sometimes it's difficult to know wether or not it works: for vulnerability #2 for the blue site I didn't realize that I had to load back the site instead of just reloading the page (thus, Blue 2.5). I couldn't get the CRSF attack on the red site to quite work.
